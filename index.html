<div class="col-md-8">
<p>My name is Colin Corrigan. I&#39;m a curious developer who loves to tinker with new technologies and find interesting ways to leverage them to solve problems. I&#39;m currently located in the Pacific Northwest and have learned to love the outdoors since moving this way from Philadelphia. I have become an avid hiker and mountaineer, and am fortunate to be currently employed by the Washington State Health Care Authority. It allows me to fulfill my passion for building interesting things and solving complex problems, while also having a net positive impact on society.</p>

<h3>Washington State Health Care Authority</h3>

<h4>Senior Web Developer (ITS4)</h4>

<p>During my time as Senior Web Developer at HCA, I oversaw the rebuild of both the agencies internal and external websites. This included architecting our new platform in the move from a SharePoint environment to Drupal 7. This role fulfilled both tackling the most challenging problems and features as well as code reviewing and guiding both internal and external resources. I served as the primary point of contact for all technical issues.</p>
</div>

<div data-date="April 2014 – September 2015">
<h3>Washington State Health Care Authority</h3>

<h4>Web Developer (ITS3)</h4>

<p>This position began as responding to tickets in support of an agency web property but I was quickly moved into a development role after demonstrating my aptitude. From that point, I was responsible for developing solutions in SharePoint 2010 and 2013 (which served as our external web presence as well as our intranet). Along with work in SharePoint, I also aided in the maintenance of a handful of databases, as well as creating and maintaining reports.</p>

<h3>Kini Consulting</h3>

<h4>Contractor</h4>

<p>As contracted help, I served as Quality Assurance for a new release of a propriety pricing analytics software. This included writing and executing test scripts to confirm functionality and ensure that the design was implemented correctly.</p>
</div>

<div data-date="January 2010 – December 2012">
<h3>Freelance</h3>

<h4>VBA/Excel Developer</h4>

<p>I utilized VBA to create and maintain reports and tools on a per project basis. An example of such a project was an automated tool that allowed users to calculate recommended calorie intake as well as recommended exercise. The client, a personal trainer, required that this work be accessible in Excel (despite its obvious limitations). Utilizing VBA I was able to design and implement a user interface for the layman, optimize performance, and provide a fully functioning tool that pushed the limits of the software.</p>

<div data-date="Feb 2005 – September 2005">
<h3>Generation YES</h3>

<h4>Web Developer Intern</h4>

<p>Selected from a competitive group of high school students, I helped to implement and maintain the non-profit&#39;s education tool, GenTECH. This included implementing features in Ruby on their platform as well as creating and maintaining a company JavaScript library. During my time at Generation YES, I implemented work varying from a new login portal to interactive maps utilized by students and prospective clients.</p>

<h3>Capital High School</h3>

<h4>Web Developer</h4>

<p>Selected to assist the staff in maintaining and redesigning the school&#39;s website. In this role, I supported faculty, as well as the IT staff, in implementing a brand new standards compliant website that is still being to used to some extent.</p>

<h3>Washington State Health Care Authority Website Rebuild</h3>

<p>This was a massive project that involved completely rebuilding the agencies externally facing website. This included reworking 1300+ pages of content and wading through 25,000 documents. Along with the content rework, we moved from SharePoint into a Drupal platform. This site garners traffic of over 250,000 constituents per month.</p>

<h3>Washington State Health Care Authority Intranet Rebuild</h3>

<p>Running simultaneous to the rework of the external face, this project was identical to the above except with a different property. With a comparatively modest sum of 100 pages and 5000 documents, this content was also completely reviewed as well as moved into a Drupal 7 environment.</p>

<h3>Custom SharePoint Video Player</h3>

<p>Given system restraints, the agency was not able to host their internal videos within SharePoint. The solution to this involved writing a custom video player that allowed us to reference videos outside of SharePoint in a shared drive. This project was completed within a very short time frame and we were able to meet and exceed expectations on both functionality and design.</p>

<h3>Mootoob</h3>

<p>A collaboration with a local artist, this game saw one cow facing a plethora of dangerous white water rapids armed with nothing but his tube to help him. This game was developed entirely in JavaScript with some of its tooling created in PHP (level editor). Leveraging the HTML canvas and JavaScripts event system, a fully playable game was created natively in JavaScript to run on any HTML5 compatible browser.</p>
